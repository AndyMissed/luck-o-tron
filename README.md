# L-O-T Discord Bot
This is the home of my Discord bot, Luck-o-Tron.

It can roll dice for you as many times as you want, and with a specified amount of sides (up to 9999).

This bot also implements a luck system which allows you to tip the odds in your favor (or not).
# About This Project
I made this bot out of a passive interest in making one, combined with my passion for randomness and math.

At the moment, it isn't a very useful bot, but it is a nice first hobby project that I can call mine.

In the near future, this bot will hopefully be hosted 24/7 and potentially be made public.

I will be sure to update this as things change.
