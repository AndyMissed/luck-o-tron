# L-o-T Discord Bot
This is the home of my Discord bot, Luck-o-Tron.

It can roll dice for you as many times as you want, and with a specified amount of sides (up to 9999).

This bot also implements a luck system which allows you to tip the odds in your favor (or not).
# About This Project
I made this bot out of a passive interest in making one, combined with my passion for randomness and math.

At the moment, it isn't a very useful bot, but it is a nice first hobby project that I can call mine.

This bot was previously being hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4. Due to personal reasons, it is no longer online. However, this is the official link for adding the bot to a Discord server, even though it will not currently work:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=632802803059916811&permissions=18432&scope=bot

I may start hosting it again in the future, but I probably wont do that until the new features teased for bots are added in Discord, and my bot gets a new coat of paint.

New features may be added in the future, and any suggestions are welcome.
# Dependencies
This bot utilizes dotenv to fetch sensitive information (My bot's token) from a '.env' file.

This bot also makes use of 'discord.py'.
